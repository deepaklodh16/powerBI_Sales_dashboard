# powerBI_Sales_dashboard

I have developed a comprehensive visualization dashboard utilizing Power BI, focusing on the sales performance of an e-commerce platform offering furniture, clothing, and other products. The dashboard presents an insightful graphical representation of specific sales transactions, correlating them with different modes of payment, all organized according to the respective months of the year. This visualization provides a clear understanding of sales trends, payment preferences, and their temporal distribution.
